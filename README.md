### Introduction 
**What's OpenProp?**

OpenProp is my open-source, not-for-profit project to help genuine home buyers by providing transparent property market data visualization in Singapore.


**What Are The Drivers For This Project?**

* Exaggeration in the news headline.
* Realtors are benefiting from these headlines while genuine buyers suffer.
* Lack of data visualization despite transparent transaction data provided by gov.

The analyses are often found to be misleading in the mainstream media. One may see a headline like "S$2000 psf is the new norm for RCR (Rest of the core Region)" or "Transaction volumes jumped 70% for April". Like every potential home buyer, I was puzzled by such wording and tried to search for supporting data. While I did find the headline to be correct in a way, it skewed more towards an interpretation of the data set which caught the audience's eyeball.I try to search websites from popular realtors but soon realize that their core business is to serve property agents for selling homes. Exaggerated headlines help their core business by creating a sense of urgency. Therefore, I don't find a good technical solution online to guide genuine home buyers.On the other hand, government agencies publish weekly property market data and have an initiative for innovative solutions leveraging their data.
